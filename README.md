# pymontecarlo
(Currently under development!)
A small Python library for creating simple Monte Carlo simulations.

## Installation
```bash
pip install montecarlo
```

## Example
(See examples directory for more examples)
```python
from montecarlo import montecarlo
from random import randint

def flip_is_heads(g):
    return randint(0, 1) == 0

mc = montecarlo(flip_coin)
mc.run()
```

Output:
```
Iteration #10000: 0.5079
Iteration #20000: 0.50485
Iteration #30000: 0.5059
Iteration #40000: 0.50295
...
Iteration #970000: 0.499608247423
Iteration #980000: 0.499712244898
Iteration #990000: 0.499737373737
Iteration #1000000: 0.499728

## Usage
The `setup` function passed should return a dictionary which is then passed into your test function.

The `func` function passed should have a single required parameter, a dictionary, which is generated by `setup` or empty otherwise. It should return a boolean (True for success or False otherwise).

Currently, `teardown` doesn't do much besides get called.

The montecarlo.run() method will also accept optional parameters `iterations` and `print_every`. The simulation will print the current probability every `print_every` iterations and will run for `iterations` iterations.
